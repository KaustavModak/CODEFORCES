# Competitive Programming Practice on Codeforces

Welcome to my Competitive Programming repository! 🚀

## About
This repository contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems, primarily from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). I am using this space to practice and improve my problem-solving skills, explore different algorithms and data structures, and track my progress over time.

## Structure
- Each folder or file is named according to the contest or problem set it belongs to.
- Solutions are written in **JAVA** (or specify your preferred language if different).
- Wherever possible, I include explanations or comments to make the solutions easier to understand.

## Goals
- Enhance problem-solving skills 💡
- Improve algorithmic thinking 🧠
- Prepare for competitive programming contests 🏆
- Learn from mistakes and optimize solutions 📈

## How to Use
Feel free to browse through the solutions, learn from them, and suggest improvements. If you're also practicing competitive programming, let's connect and grow together!
